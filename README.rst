Alignak checks package for NRPE
===============================

Checks pack for monitoring hosts with NRPE


**Beware**: This checks pack is now deprecated. It has been replaced with `alignak-checks-linux-nrpe` that makes its naming more consistent with the used naming conventions.

The current future-master branch in this repository contains the modifications used as a basis for the next repository.

As of now, see: https://github.com/Alignak-monitoring-contrib/alignak-checks-linux-nrpe
